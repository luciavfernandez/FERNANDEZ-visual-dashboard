# Spotify Data Insights Dashboard

## Overview

This dashboard visualizes personal Spotify listening data to uncover behavioral patterns and provide actionable insights for music industry professionals, particularly for timing music releases and optimizing user engagement.

## Project Context

**Target Audience:** Music industry managers and decision-makers  
**Time Commitment:** 10-minute review  
**Data Source:** Personal Spotify listening history  
**Created By:** @luciavfernandez

## What Does This Dashboard Show?

The dashboard analyzes personal music listening habits across multiple dimensions:

### 📅 **Temporal Patterns**
- **Listening hours by month** - Reveals seasonal trends and peak periods
- **Day of week analysis** - Shows concentration of listening activity

### 🎵 **Music Preferences**
- **Hours by artist** - Identifies most-played artists
- **Hours by song title** - Highlights top tracks
- **Language preferences** - Analyzes listening patterns by song language

## Key Insights Discovered

### 1. **Optimal Release Timing**
- 🎯 **+50% more listening on weekends** (especially Fridays)
- ❄️ **+30% more listening during winter holidays**
- 📈 **Peak activity at end of quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)**

**Business Application:** Artists should prioritize releasing music on Fridays and during winter holiday periods to maximize initial engagement.

### 2. **Language Personalization**
- 🗣️ **Preference for Spanish-language music** over other languages
- 🎯 **Playlists with native language content show higher engagement**

**Business Application:** Recommendation algorithms should prioritize content in the user's preferred language for better retention.

### 3. **The "Shuffle Paradox"**
- 🔀 **Top songs don't always match language preferences**
- 💡 **Only 1 of top 5 songs is in Spanish** (despite Spanish being preferred overall)
- 🎲 **Spotify's shuffle algorithm is NOT random** - it's curated based on listening history

**Business Application:** Understanding that users are more likely to complete songs from their "top played" list can improve shuffle algorithms and engagement metrics.

## Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is organized into multiple views:

1. **Overall** - High-level summary of listening behavior
2. **Context** - Background and methodology
3. **Periods** - Temporal analysis (monthly, weekly patterns)
4. **Artists** - Artist-based listening breakdown
5. **Documentation** - Design choices and data explanations
6. **Credits** - Data sources and references

## Why This Matters

Personal data dashboards reveal the **"bigger picture"** of user behavior, especially when real-time data isn't always available to industry professionals. This type of analysis helps:

- **Artists** time their releases strategically
- **Platforms** improve recommendation algorithms
- **Marketers** target campaigns more effectively
- **Product teams** optimize shuffle and autoplay features

## Technical Details

- **Tool Used:** Power BI
- **Data Period:** Multiple years of listening history
- **Update Frequency:** Based on Spotify data export
- **Interactivity:** Multiple filters and drill-down capabilities

## Key Recommendations

Based on the data analysis:

1. ✅ **Release music at end of quarters** (+30% engagement potential)
2. ✅ **Release music on Fridays** (+50% engagement potential)
3. ✅ **Personalize playlists by language AND artist preferences**
4. ✅ **Optimize shuffle to favor top-played songs** for better completion rates
